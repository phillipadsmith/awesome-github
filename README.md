> A curated list of GitHub's awesomeness

Think GitHub is awesome? Contribute something to this list! It's easy, just have a look at the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The awesomeness is currently organized into just a few different buckets: 

* [Infomation for people who are new to GitHub](#infomation-for-people-who-are-new-to-github)
* [Resources for those already familiar with GitHub](#resources-for-those-already-familiar-with-github)
* [Tips, tricks, tools, and add-ons for GitHub power users](#tips-tricks-tools-and-add-ons-for-github-power-users)
* [Novel uses of GitHub](#novel-uses-of-github)

What is the [Awesome GitHub](https://github.com/phillipadsmith/awesome-github) list? It's a collection of things that make **GitHub** one of the most amazing co-creation platforms in the world.

It is specifically focused on _GitHub_, and not on [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Git is indeed awesome. And there would be no GitHub without Git. And yet, GitHub has become much more than a home to much of humanity's open-source code; it has become one of the world's most vivid examples of the power of mass collaboration.

All that to say, this list -- [Awesome GitHub](https://github.com/phillipadsmith/awesome-github) -- is an attempt to document that aspect of what is awesome: everything that GitHub has become -- far beyond what Git is today, and beyond where GitHub started just eight years ago.

The inspiration for this list came from [a session proposal](http://phillipadsmith.com/2015/09/github-gitdown.html) for the [2015 Mozilla Festival](https://2015.mozillafestival.org/). I later learned, serendiptiously, that the Mozilla Festival itself was using [GitHub issues to manage the program](https://github.com/mozilla/mozfest-program) -- reviewing proposals, assign sessions to tracks and themes, and much more. Just one more example of how GitHub is being used to make awesome.
